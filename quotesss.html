      <div><h2>

      Welcome to the Hobbies Area!

        

          </h2></div>


        <p> 
            
            Ranging from playing various musical instuments, to be active outside, there are a lot of different things that interest me. I am a type of person who is not picky in food, and coincedentally, I am a type of person who is not picky in doing activites either. Even if I am not good at doing a certain sport, I will try my best to succeed in it, I would like to call myself slightly competetive. Being active is in my blood, for even my paretns have participated in various activities as well : track, basketball, cricket, tennis, etc. However, if I do end up losing in a sport, I accept it with a smile on my face, for a game is only but a game, and both sides should be fair and respectful. </br>
      Moving away from sports, I do enjoy playing games: involving the computper and just games in general. I like being challenged and trying out new things: it allows me to gain different perspectives of something. When it comes to music, I tend to explore and try not to find a limit for myself; for example, I have played up to 5 intruments in the past: clarinet, viola, piano, guitar, and the flute. Oh and I cannot leave out my voice. So that makes it 6 instruments. No matter how old I get, I will always ready to go to Disney World. Being able to be a kid again will always be my secret goal and letting loose and forgetting my actual age is an easy task to do when it comes to Disney. I will always be that one person who always cries during Disney movies, no matter how cheesy they are. Whenever I am bored, I always tend to find a pencil in my hand, for I love drawing. Being artistic and creative can show a colorful side, and I seem to be that type of person who will forever love the world of art. All in all, I would like to call myself a girl who does not like being in one place for too long, unless I have a good book in my hands.
